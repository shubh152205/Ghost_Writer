# Ghost Typer

**Ghost Typer** is a Chrome extension designed to assist developers and users in simulating typing and bypassing paste restrictions on various platforms. It's particularly useful for coding platforms like GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode, and HackerRank that sometimes block direct pasting or mess up formatting.

## Features

*   **Smart Insert (GeeksforGeeks Mode)**: intelligently inserts text into code editors, bypassing anti-paste scripts while preserving code formatting. Ideal for competitive programming sites.
*   **Slow Type Mode**: Simulates natural human typing speed. This is useful for regular forms or environments that detect rapid input or "bot-like" behavior.

    *   **Insert to GeeksforGeeks**: Click this button if you are on a coding platform editor. It will instantly insert the text as if you typed it, handling indentation correctly.
    *   **Slow Type (Regular Forms)**: Click this button for standard text inputs where you want to simulate typing char-by-char.
